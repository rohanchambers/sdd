                            <h2>Brief:</h2>
                            <p>The brief from the client was "We need a fresh new branding and website to replace the dated look we currently have". Our job was to bring Closy market up to date with a premium looking site that was gonna attract new customers and create more purchases. Closy market is about, fresh food from local markets delivered to your door with a big emphasis on eco friendly vans used for all deliveries.</p>
                            <p>Closy Market originally launched in London and we were suppose to push the new branding in both London and Barcelona but due to Covid restrictions some delays took affect and we are waiting for the right time to launch, hopefully soon. The next phase which is currenlty in progress is creating the iphone and android app. for all online shopping and deliveries.</p>

                            <p>We delivered a premium rebranding and a functioning site that is not just an average boring template that you can see on everyones site. Everything from the design to the build was original and developed from the ground up. We look forward to seeing the brand grow over the next year with the buzz we are implementing hopefully attracting many new customers.</p>
                            <p>We look forward to working on this brand again very soon.</p>
