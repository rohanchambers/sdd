                        <p>Europe’s New Wild is the epic, panoramic, and inspiring story of nature’s return to a continent. For thousands of years, humans have dominated Europe. Great civilizations have risen and fallen, ancient forests replaced with sprawling cities, and countless wild species driven to remote corners of the continent or even to extinction.</p>
                        <p>Today, a specialist team of conservation professionals, scientists, and wildlife experts has been assembled, their mission is monumental in its scope and daunting in its scale: to rewild at least one million hectares of European landscape by 2022.</p>

                            <h2>Client: <span><a href="http://www.offthefence.com" target="_blank">Off the Fence</a></span></h2>
                            <h2>Project Link:</h2> <p>Internal link only (until launch)</p>

                        <h2>Brief:</h2>
                        <p>Off the Fence wanted a way to present their latest documentary series in development: 'Europe's New Wild' to raise production-financing for the show. Not only would this be for client presentations, it would also be a way to pass on all relevant information regarding the production of this program to investors via an online solution. This would mean no more lengthy pdf creations for the series and more importantly an easy way to update content that can all be done online in a matter of minutes. Up until the documentary launches the site will only be available to potential investors, thereafter it will act as a supporting site and a way of promoting the documentary online and via social media.</p>
                        <p>The brief was slick, simple and allowed Slam Dunk Digital to create an easy to navigate informational microsite showing off some of the gorgeous shots taken by the film crew.</p>
